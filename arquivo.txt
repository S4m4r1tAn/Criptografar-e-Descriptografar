What you think you can bring to this programme:

I am a husband, happily married and a father of two beautiful boys. 
As a Bachelor in Business with emphasis in Import and Export, I’ve 
learned that we should work smart rather than work hard, so for instance 
I will bring all my will to learn, my responsibility, my ambition, my 
qualities, my values, my interests, my academic and life knowledge, my 
internships skills and life experience.
I will also bring my passion for solving problems and my ability to turn 
them into opportunities, also my desire for understanding how things work. 
Never forgetting that my curiosity and insight will lead me to identify 
and analyse using all the relevant information’s ensuring and proposing 
solutions that will help the team, always having as a goal the success of 
the team and the prosperity of the company.
